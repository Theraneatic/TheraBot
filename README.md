# TheraBot
A selfbot created by Theraneatic.

A selfbot is a bot that uses a user profile. These bots are bound by the same rules you are. I am not responsible for your account being banned or otherwise modified by this bot. By using this bot, you agree to these terms.

To use the selfbot on your own, you will need you own user token and ID, which can be gotten through
1:ctrl-shift-i
2:Application>Local Storage>discordapp.com>token
and enabling developer mode, right clicking on your name, and clicking copy ID. Create a json file with this syntax:
{
  "token":"<token>",
  "id":"<id>"
}
Once this is complete, name the file information.json and put it in the same folder the bot is in. Then, run it through node. YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST NODE 6.0.0 OR HIGHER AND THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF DISCORD.JS TO USE THIS. Node can be installed through here, https://nodejs.org/en/ (I recommend the most current version) and Discord.js can be installed by using npm i discord.js after node has finished installing. Then, type in node and the path to this bot, and the bot should be operational.
Thank you for using TheraBot.
