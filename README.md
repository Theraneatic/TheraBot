# TheraBot
A selfbot created by Theraneatic.

A selfbot is a bot that uses a user profile. These bots are bound by the same rules you are. I am not responsible for your account being banned or otherwise modified by this bot. By using this bot, you agree to these terms.
# Warning
Selfbots are against Discord ToS. While they typically do not go after selfbot users tha do not abuse the API, please fully consider the risk before using this bot.

To use the selfbot on your own, you will need you own user token and ID, which can be gotten through
1:ctrl-shift-i

2:Application>Local Storage>discordapp.com>token

3: Enabling developer mode, right clicking on your name, and clicking copy ID. Create a json file with this syntax:

{

  "token":"yourtoken",

  "id":"yourid"

}

Once this is complete, name the file information.json and put it in the same folder the bot is in. Then, run it through node. YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST NODE 6.0.0 OR HIGHER AND VERSION 11.0.0 OR HIGHER OF DISCORD.JS TO USE THIS. Node can be installed through here, https://nodejs.org/en/ (I recommend the most current version) and Discord.js can be installed by using npm i discord.js after node has finished installing. Also download performance-now and pretty-bytes using the same method. Then, type in node and the path to this bot, and the bot should be operational.

Thank you for using TheraBot.
